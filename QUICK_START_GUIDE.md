## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Step 2: Implement Backend Endpoints

You need to add 3 new endpoints to your backend. See `BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for:
- `/api/promo/validate` - Validate promo codes
- `/api/newsletter/subscribe` - Newsletter signup
- `/api/orders` - Get user orders (likely already exists)

### Step 3: Test New Features

**Test Orders Page:**
- Navigate to `/orders` (you need to be logged in)
- Should display all your orders with status badges

**Test Promo Codes:**
- Go to cart and try entering a promo code
- Backend must be configured for this to work

**Test Newsletter:**
- Go to home page
- Scroll to bottom and enter email in newsletter signup
- Backend must be configured for this to work

## 💻 Development Tips

### 1. Testing Promo Codes
Create test codes in your database:
```javascript
{
  code: "TEST10",
  discountType: "percentage",
  discountValue: 10,
  maxDiscount: 500,
  minOrderValue: 100,
  expiryDate: new Date('2025-12-31')
}
```

### 2. Testing Orders
Orders will display once you:
- Create orders through checkout
- Backend stores them properly
- API endpoint `/api/orders` returns data in correct format

### 3. Newsletter Emails
To send actual emails, implement:
- SMTP setup with Nodemailer
- Email templates
- Send on subscription confirmation
- Send newsletter campaigns

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Promo Codes Not Working
- Check backend endpoint is registered
- Verify route is correct: `/api/promo/validate`
- Check error messages in browser console
- Ensure authentication token is sent

### Orders Not Loading
- Verify API endpoint: `/api/orders`
- Check user is authenticated
- Look for errors in browser console
- Ensure orders exist in database

### Animations Not Showing
- Check browser console for CSS errors
- Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check if hardware acceleration is enabled

### Newsletter Not Working
- Verify endpoint: `/api/newsletter/subscribe`
- Check email validation
- Ensure database connection is working
- Look for duplicate email errors

## 📊 Performance Tips

1. **Lazy Load Images** - Images use placeholder while loading
2. **Optimized Animations** - Use `transform` and `opacity` for smooth 60fps
3. **Debounced Events** - Promo code validation includes loading state
4. **Cache Data** - React Query caches orders for 5 minutes

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Promo Code Validation**
   - Always validate on backend (already done)
   - Check expiry dates
   - Verify usage limits
   - Prevent manipulation

2. **Newsletter**
   - Validate email format
   - Check for duplicates
   - Require confirmation (recommended)
   - GDPR compliant unsubscribe

- ✅ Orders page - Works on mobile
